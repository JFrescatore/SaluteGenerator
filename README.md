# SaluteGenerator
Program Made in Unity to Generate SALUTE Reports for training.
Hundreds of voice files were compiled to create coherent radio chatter thaat students would listen to and respond to
in real time for training. Voice lines could be mixed and matched to generate dozens upon dozens of different
reports with no pattern, all in order to keep the student aware and on edge. The randomness prevented the student from 
becoming comfortable with things they have alreay dealt with and would keep the situation fresh.
